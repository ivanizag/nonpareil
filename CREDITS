my fault.

The full list of credits is getting long, so it is now in the file CREDITS.

Nonpareil was originally written by Eric Smith.  Any bugs in it are
my fault.

Peter Monta found and corrected typographical errors in my entry of
the HP-45 and HP-55 source code, and provided the HP-35 code based on
an *optical* ROM dump:

The HP-41C image (hp41cv.png) is a stylized illustration rendered by
my older NSIM simulator with improvements by Maciej Bartosiak and
Thomas Olesen.  The HP-15C and HP-16C images are also by Maciej Barosiak,
and the HP-11C and HP-12C images are derived from them.

Thomas Olesen improved the HP-41CV KML file for a more realistic display
"font" and alpha keyboard mapping.

Images of the HP-21, HP-25, HP-32E, HP-33C, HP-34C, HP-35, HP-37E,
HP-38C, HP-45, HP-55, and HP-80 are copyrighted by David Hicks of the
Museum of HP Calculators and have been included in this package by his

Allen Kossow provided a HP 16500B logic analyzer when mine broke, and
some deep memory acquisition cards for it.

Bernhard Engl, Richard Ottosen, and Jim Phillips provided assistance with
circuit designs for PMOS interfacing.

Bernhard Engl built a Woodstock ROM emulator which was used to run a
keycode test program on the HP-67, and he reverse-engineered the
details of the bank-switching feature of the Woodstock series ROM
chips, which turned out to be slightly different than that of the
Spice series, which I'd already reverse-engineerd.

Nelson Sicuro, Randy Sloyer, and Kenneth Sumrall provided calculators
and technical assistance.

Warren Furlow, David Hicks, Wlodek Mier-Jedrzejowicz, and Jake Schwartz
provided copies of various technical documentation.

Hedley Rainnie prodded me multiple times to work on simulation of the
Voyager calculators, and HrastProgrammer provided invaluable assistance
in getting the Voyager simulation working correctly.

Steven Ellis and Steven Knight helped with the SConstruct and SConscript
files, which are used to build the Nonpareil using SCons rather than make.
I also used an SCons source tarball builder posted to the scons-users
mailing list by Paul Davis.  Additional SCons advice was provided by
Timothee Besset.

Adam Sampson's efforts at constructing GARstow packages of Nonpareil
convinced me to make various improvements to the SConstruct/SConscript
files.  He also reported several bugs in the code and in the build process,
and provided patches and suggestions.

Warren Furlow developed the .mod file format, and provided public domain
code to work with mod files, as part of his V41 source code:
        http://www.hp41.org/Emulation.cfm

Chris Roccati and Christophe Gottheimer each independently added proper
bank switching to my older NSIM HP-41C simulator.  Chris Roccati implemented
the Phineas (timer) chip, and Thomas Olesen ported his changes to Nonpareil.
I did not incorporate that code directly, but did use it as a model.

Christophe Gottheimer also implemented simulation of the HEPAX module in
NSIM, and I expect to incorporate that into Nonpareil in the near future.

Tony Phillips provided an audio recording of a Canada goose, from his
web site "Songs and callse of some New York State birds":

John Hogerhuis helped get the keyboard support working again, and contributed
better key bindings for the 12C.

Les Bell provided a high-resolution greyscale scan of the 82143A character
set, from which I was able to make corrections to my character generator
table.

Additional bug reports and fixes were provided by Florian Engelhardt.

If I've omitted anyone who should be listed here, I apologize, and
please let me know so I can remedy the omission.
