* When using GDB to debug Nonpareil, sometimes GDB will stop with a
  message "Program received signal SIG33, Real-time event 33.".

  You can give the command "handle SIG33 nostop noprint", then continue.

  In case you're wondering, a SIG33 is a German tank with a 150 mm
  howitzer.  Naturally GDB is somewhat taken aback upon encountering one.


* If you need to inspect the contents of a Nonpareil state save file,
  which is a gzip-compressed XML file, a convenient way to do it is to use
  xmllint (part of the libxml2 package):

      xmllint --format ~/41CV.nst | more
