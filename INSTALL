Toolchain and build-time dependencies (not needed at runtime):

Nonpareil is written in C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999), Flex, and Bison, and
is normally built using the GNU toolchain.  No effort has been made to
build it with a non-GNU toolchain.

			minimum		recommended
			version		version
			-------		-----------
    GCC					3.42
    Flex		2.4.2		2.4.7
    Bison		1.22		1.875c
    SCons		0.96.90		0.96.90
    Python		1.5.2		2.3.4
    NetPBM				10.25

In addition, the libraries and header files for the runtime dependencies
must be available at build time.  A list of these is in the README file.

If you do not wish to install SCons on your system, a standalone copy
is provided in the directory scons-local.  For information on SCons,
see the web site:

        http://www.scons.org/

Building Nonpareil:

If you have SCons installed on your system, and are satisfied with the
default configuration options, building Nonpareil is as simple as
giving the command

	% scons

If you do not wish to install scons, unpack the supplied scons-local tarball
with this command:

	% (cd scons-local; tar -xzf scons-local-0.96.90.tar.gz)

Using scons-local simply requires substituting "scons-local/scons.py"
whereever these instructions call for the use of scons.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Nonpareil:

The default installation of scons may be accomplished by the command:

	% scons install

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration:

Nonpareil has a number of configuration options that may be set at
compile time by command line arguments to scons.  Brief descriptions
of the configuration options as well as their default and current
settings may be obtained with the command "scons -h".

The configuration options are cached in a file "nonpareil.conf" in the
top-level directory.  To reset all settings to their default values, delete
this file.

The Nonpareil installation prefix defaults to "/usr/local".  If you want
Nonpareil to be installed in a different directory, set the prefix to
a different path when building Nonpareil, e.g.

	% scons prefix=/path/to/base/install/directory

By default, the Nonpareil executable programs will be installed in a
"bin" directory under the prefix path, and the KML, ROM, and image
files will be installed in a "lib/nonpareil" directory under the
prefix path.  Thus the full defaults paths are "/usr/local/bin/nonpareil"
and "/usr/local/lib/nonpareil/*.kml" etc.  For more control over the
installation locations of the binaries and library files, you can
use the "bindir" and "libdir" configuration options.

When building binary packages (e.g., RPM, deb, or GARstow), it is often
convenient to install into a virtual root directory.  This can be
accomplished using the "destdir" configuration option.  For instance:

	% scons install prefix=/usr destdir=/var/tmp/nonpareil-3874

will install the executables into "/var/tmp/nonpareil-3874/usr/bin/",
and the library files into "/var/tmp/nonpareil-3874/usr/lib/nonpareil/",
though they will be configured for actual runtime use in "/usr/bin/"
and "/usr/lib/nonpareil/".
